Certainly! To run a Flask app and connect the backend to the frontend, follow these steps. Assuming your Flask app is already set up:

Activate Virtual Environment:

bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Run Flask App:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Make sure that you are in the correct directory where your app.py file is located.

Check Output:
Once the app is running, you should see output indicating that the Flask app has started and is listening on a specific port (usually localhost:5000 by default).

Open Browser:
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000 (or the specified port in your Flask app's output). This is where your Flask app is serving.

Connect Frontend:
Make sure your frontend is configured to send requests to the correct endpoints on the backend (e.g., http://localhost:5000/create_employee). Update the URLs in your frontend code accordingly.

For example, if you're using JavaScript for the frontend, you might have something like this:

javascript
Copy code
fetch('http://localhost:5000/create_employee', {
  // ... other options
})
Test Endpoints:
Test your endpoints by interacting with the frontend. For instance, if you have a form on your frontend to create an employee, fill out the form and submit it. Check the Flask app's console output for any logs or errors.

Remember to replace http://localhost:5000 with the appropriate URL if you're deploying your app elsewhere.
